ERfMRI defines the template class, to run an experiment subclass it.

I took the class/subclass approach to maximize flexibility,readability and maintainability at the cost of possible confusion for non-programmers.
  
The subclass should define any models you want to compare/simulate.  
	See exp/example.py for an example.

Once coded the experiment should be simply run by:
results = [ExpSubclass(**params).run(i) for i range(100)]
	# 100 iterations

Making it simple to use with Ipython's engines, SGE, OGE or a Hadoop interface (with a suitable reducer of course).
